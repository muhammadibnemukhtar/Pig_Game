1. The game has two players, Player 1 and Player 2.
2. Players take turns rolling a single dice.
3. During each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they wish to

   their turn ends.
5. A player can choose to "Pass," which adds their current turn score to
   their total score and ends their turn.
6. The game ends when both players have passed three times.
7. The player with the highest total score wins.
